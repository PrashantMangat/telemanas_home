Consequently, the MoHFW formed a National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) and three technical advisory sub-committees (Mental Health Service Delivery, Information Technology Architecture and Health Systems) to achieve specific goals and objectives of Tele MANAS.",
        "AboutText2": "Tele MANAS will be organized as a two-tier system. Tier 1 will comprise the State Tele MANAS cells, which includes trained counsellors and mental health specialists. Tier 2 will comprise specialists at District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)/Medical College resources for physical consultation and/or eSanjeevani for audio visual consultation.",
        "HowitWorks": "How it Works?",
        "TeleMANASCallingMechanism": "Tele MANAS Calling Mechanism",
        "AboutBullet1": "The public can access the Tele MANAS helpline by dialing tollfree number or short code. This call will be an IVRS based audio calling only, with a timely auto-call back approach. Through the automated callback service, the caller will first be attended to by a trained counsellor.",
        "AboutBullet2": "Based on the level of care required, the counsellor will either provide the care needed within their capabilities or refer the caller for specialist care.",
        "AboutBullet3": "If the caller requires specialized care, the call will be handled by a mental health specialist (clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker, psychiatric nurse, or a psychiatrist). This level of service will contain both audio as well as video-based options.",
        "AboutBullet4": "In case the caller requires urgent in-person intervention/complex evaluations and management, they will be referred to the nearest in-person service for physical consultation and/or an audio-visual consultation with a specialist will be arranged through eSanjeevani. These centers will range from Health and Wellness Centre (HWCs) to tertiary care centers as part of the DMHP.",
        "AimText1": "To provide universal access to equitable, accessible, affordable and quality mental health care through 24X7 tele-mental health services as a digital component of the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) across all Indian States and UTs with assured linkages.",
        "AimBullet1": "To exponentially scale up the reach of mental health services to anybody who reaches out, across India, any time, by setting up a 24x7 tele-mental health facility in each of the States and IJTs of the country",
        "AimBullet2": "To implement a full-fledged mental health-service network that, in addition to counselling, provides integrated medical and psychosocial interventions including video consultations with mental health specialists, e-prescriptions, follow-up services and linkages to in-person services.",
        "AimBullet3": "To extend services to vulnerable groups of the population and difficult to reach populations",
        "BackgroundText1": "India comprises around 18% of the global population and significantly contributes to the global burden of mental disorders. In 2019, mental disorders were the second leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs), and self-harm and violence were the tenth leading cause of death. Evidence suggests that suicide deaths increased by 40% from 1990 to 2016 making it the third leading cause of death in several Indian states. Recent national level studies have highlighted that 15% of the adult population in India have mental health issues requiring intervention and a wide treatment gap of 70-92% exists for a range of mental disorders. Thus, a large segment of the population requires assistance for mental health and well-being.",
        "BackgroundText2": "The Government of Indiaâ€™s (GoI) recent mental health initiatives include the National Mental Health Policy, 2014, that envisages the provision of universal access to mental health care and the National Mental Health Policy, 2017, that recognises mental health as one of the policy thrust areas. The new Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, enshrines access to mental health as a statutory right and an entitlement, including its provision through primary healthcare.",
        "BackgroundText3": "The Government of India launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, in response to the heavy burden of mental illness and critical need of mental health care infrastructure in the community.",
        "BackgroundText4": "The District Mental Health Program (DMHP) was appended to the NMHP in 1996 to overcome the shortcomings of the programme and transitioned the districts into administrative and implementation units for NMHP. The DMHP envisages extending mental health services through the existing healthcare infrastructure and human resources at the community level. With regard to Mental Health services, providing in-person healthcare is challenging, particularly given the large geographical distances and limited resources. Therefore, the Government of India has implemented the use of telemedicine through eSanjeevani in the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) that saves the cost and effort, especially of rural patients, as they need not travel long distances for obtaining consultation and treatment. Mainstreaming telemedicine in the Indian health system has minimized inequity and barriers to access. The large number of daily consultations on eSanjeevani are a testament to this fact. Advocating the use of digital tools for improving the efficiency and outcome of the healthcare system, particularly in the domain of mental health care, the National Tele Mental Health Programme, Tele Mental Health Assistance and Networking Across States (Tele MANAS) was announced by the Honâ€™ble Union Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2022. The apex institutions (NIMHANS, IIIT-B, NHSRC), regional co-ordinating centres and mentoring institutions will be working closely with the states/UTs in all these activities by providing support for technical issues, collaborative consultations, capacity building, implementation, service provision, linkages, monitoring and evaluation, research, innovations etc.",
        "OrganizationalText1": "In addition to the steering committees, the Apex Nodal Institute for mentoring and monitoring of Tele MANAS will be NIMHANS. Five regional coordinating centers: NIMHANS, Bengaluru; LGBRIMH, Tezpur; CIP, Ranchi; IHBAS, Delhi; and PGIMER, Chandigarh will assist NIMHANS in co-ordination with the 23 mentoring Institutions and 51 State/UT cells",

        "NationalBullet2": "Review the deliverables and Identify the future priorities, opportunities, and challenges and to suggest appropriate action.",
        "NationalBullet3": "Provide advice to the apex nodal center regarding its tele mental health Programme activities.Periodically review the emerging evidence in the area and provide course corrections.",
